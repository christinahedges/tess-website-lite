Title: TESS Data Products
template: slide
save_as: data-products.html

The four cameras of TESS take consecutive images of a particular region of the sky every 2 seconds. Several data products are produced by the TESS mission from these images: <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess" target="_blank">Target Pixel Files (TPFs, also known as postage stamps) of selected targets, corresponding Light Curves (LCs), and Full Frame Images (FFIs)</a>. 

Each of these is created on-board the spacecraft by co-adding the individual 2-second exposures. These data products are provided in standard FITS format with multiple extensions which contain additional information on calibration, background removal, cosmic-ray rejection, and in the case of the TPFs aperture masks indicating the pixels used to extract the lightcurve. For more information, see the <a href = "https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess/data-products" target = "_blank"> TESS mission page at MAST </a>, the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016SPIE.9913E..3EJ/abstract" target="_blank"> TESS pipeline </a>, as well as the slideshow presented below.
