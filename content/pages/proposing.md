Title: Proposing to the TESS General Investigator program

NASA's TESS is a space-based telescope that images large parts of the sky in the visible at a cadence of 2 minutes or less. TESS observes the same part of the sky continually for 28 days. TESS provides users with three different kinds of data products: 

* Target Pixel Files (TPFs)
* Light Curves (LCs)
* Full Frame Images (FFIs)

The TPFs and LCs are provided for a subset of targets, have a shorter cadence, have background removed, and are corrected by the TESS pipeline.

TESS data is public, and provides all-sky, space-based, long-duration (28+ days) precision photometry for tens of millions of sources. TESS enables studies of exoplanet systems, single and multiple stars, supernovae, galaxies, Solar System objects.  There are no reserved targets, no restricted science areas, and no proprietary period. All data is made available through MAST immediately after data processing and validation is complete.
