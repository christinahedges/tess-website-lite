Title: Proposing to the TESS General Investigator program

save_as: proposing.html

NASA's TESS is a space-based telescope that images large parts of the sky in the visible at a cadence of 2 minutes or less. TESS observes the same part of the sky continually for 28 days. The data is public, and includes precision photometry for tens of millions of sources.

TESS provides users with three different kinds of data products: <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess">Target Pixel Files (TPFs), Light Curves (LCs), and Full Frame Images (FFIs)</a>. The TPFs and LCs are provided for a subset of targets. These products have a shorter cadence, have background removed, and are corrected by the TESS pipeline, SPOC.

TESS enables studies of exoplanet systems, single and multiple stars, supernovae, galaxies, and Solar System objects.  There are no reserved targets, no restricted science areas, and no proprietary period. All data is made available through MAST immediately after data processing and validation is complete.

Below you can find more information on the TESS General Investigator (GI) Program and how to propose for TESS data and research funding. The information is presented as a slideshow separated into sections for Proposing Basics, Proposal Types, Selecting your TESS targets, Writing your proposal, Submitting your proposal, Proposal evaluation, and Additional Resources.
